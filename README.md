### OOP-FinalProject
## BattleShip Game 

On this occasion, for the final project, I made a simple warship-themed game. This game is very simple and also made with a simple GUI. The explanation of this game is first of all, this game is a player vs bot. The game starts after pressing the "START" button on the main screen. Ships available on a screen are outlined by colour for the border. The border is denoted by x,y coordinates from 1 - 8. The number of our ship and enemy ships is 5, so 5 v 5, which is where the ship was made by myself. After we attack, at the same time our enemy also attacks us. There is a chance where the enemy can hit our ship or not and if the enemy hits us, our ship loses one. The same thing when it can hit an enemy ship, then one enemy ship is also missing.
